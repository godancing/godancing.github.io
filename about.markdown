title: About Us
order: 2

Who are those folks and what's their purpose, anyway? We first described ourselves as follows:

> "GO Dancing! is a collaborative effort of dancers, callers, musicians, and the people supporting them in and around Goshen, IN."

We're a bit more formal now. The information below is from Article 2 of the Bylaws of Goshen Community Contra Dancing:

> GO Dancing! is a nonprofit community based educational organization with the following aims:
>
> 1. To encourage the practice and promote the knowledge of American traditional folk dance, music, and song.
>
> 2. To sponsor community dances
>
> 3. To train musicians, dance teachers, and leaders in order to further these objectives.
>
> 4. To cooperate with other like-minded organizations in order to further these objectives.

We achieved 501(c)3 status in October, 2002 with the help of the [Country Dance and Song Society (CDSS)](http://www.cdss.org/). GO Dancing! is now a Group Affiliate member of CDSS.

Those of us working to organize the events are grateful for the incredible response this community has shown. We hope that you will join us in this wonderful experience of music, dance, and community building.
